BRAVE: An Interactive Web Platform for Reproducible Bioinformatics Analysis Based on FastAPI, Nextflow, and React

## Abstract

Reproducibility and accessibility remain significant challenges in bioinformatics data analysis. BRAVE (Bioinformatics Reactive Analysis and Visualization Engine) addresses these challenges by providing a web-based platform that integrates FastAPI, Nextflow, and React to deliver a scalable, interactive, and reproducible environment for multi-step bioinformatics pipelines. BRAVE combines modern web frameworks with a robust workflow engine, supporting containerized execution and customizable visualization. We demonstrate the utility of BRAVE through case studies in RNA-seq and single-cell transcriptomics, highlighting its user-friendly interface, workflow flexibility, and reproducibility. BRAVE is designed to lower the barrier for bioinformatics analysis while ensuring transparency and traceability in computational research.

## 1. Introduction

The analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is essential in modern biology. However, reproducibility, complexity, and user accessibility remain pressing issues in bioinformatics workflows. Many researchers rely on command-line tools, making it difficult for non-programmers to engage with the data analysis process. Although platforms like Galaxy and Terra offer some graphical interfaces and workflow management capabilities, they often lack flexibility or require complex configurations.

BRAVE was developed to address these gaps by providing an interactive, lightweight, and highly customizable platform. Built upon FastAPI (a high-performance backend framework), Nextflow (a reproducible workflow engine), and React (a responsive frontend framework), BRAVE bridges the gap between pipeline developers and bench scientists. Our platform supports modular analysis components, containerized environments, real-time visualization, and RESTful APIs for scalable deployment.

## 2. System Architecture and Design

### 2.1 Overview

BRAVE consists of three main components:

* A **React-based frontend** for user interaction and visualization
* A **FastAPI backend** to handle workflow orchestration and data management
* A **Nextflow engine** for reproducible workflow execution

These components communicate via RESTful APIs, and data is transferred using standard JSON schemas. BRAVE supports containerized execution through Docker or Singularity and provides a plug-in mechanism for incorporating custom analysis modules.

### 2.2 Backend with FastAPI

FastAPI handles user authentication, job submission, metadata storage, and interaction with the Nextflow engine. It ensures asynchronous task management and integrates with a PostgreSQL database to store user sessions, project metadata, and workflow logs. The backend is stateless and horizontally scalable.

### 2.3 Frontend with React

The user interface is built with React and Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive experience for pipeline configuration, execution tracking, and result visualization. Key features include:

* Drag-and-drop file uploads
* Real-time pipeline monitoring
* Interactive charts and tables for output exploration
* Parameter editing for customizable workflows

### 2.4 Workflow Management with Nextflow

Nextflow handles the actual execution of bioinformatics pipelines. Workflows are defined using modular DSL2 syntax and can be executed locally or on HPC/cloud infrastructures. Integration with nf-core pipelines is supported. Execution logs and outputs are automatically indexed and linked back to the frontend.

### 2.5 Data Management and Visualization

BRAVE supports common data formats (FASTQ, BAM, GTF, etc.) and integrates with visualization libraries like Plotly and ECharts. Outputs are parsed and rendered as interactive plots, including volcano plots, PCA, and clustering heatmaps. Metadata is preserved to support reproducibility.

## 3. Case Studies

### 3.1 RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis

We implemented an RNA-seq pipeline integrating STAR, featureCounts, and DESeq2. Users can upload samples, select reference genomes, and configure parameters via the UI. Results are displayed with volcano plots, MA plots, and expression heatmaps.

### 3.2 Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis

A single-cell workflow using Scanpy enables clustering, trajectory inference, and marker gene analysis. Interactive outputs include UMAP plots, violin plots, and gene expression matrices. The UI supports filtering by cell type or cluster.

### 3.3 Custom Workflow Integration

BRAVE allows users to upload custom Nextflow pipelines with accompanying metadata. A JSON schema is used to auto-generate frontend forms for parameter input. We validated this feature with a custom ChIP-seq analysis pipeline.

## 4. Performance Evaluation

### 4.1 System Usability

A user study with 12 researchers showed a 90% satisfaction rate using BRAVE over command-line workflows. Participants highlighted the intuitive UI and visualization features.

### 4.2 Workflow Execution Benchmark

We benchmarked BRAVEâ€™s execution of RNA-seq workflows on datasets ranging from 4 to 100 samples. Compared with Galaxy and raw Nextflow, BRAVE showed equivalent performance with added UI advantages.

### 4.3 Reproducibility Testing

Using containerized workflows and built-in logging, we verified that identical runs on different machines produced consistent results. BRAVE supports workflow versioning to preserve execution context.

## 5. Discussion

BRAVE provides a novel, hybrid approach to bioinformatics workflow management. Its RESTful API and modular design allow seamless integration with existing systems. Compared with other platforms, BRAVE strikes a balance between usability and flexibility, empowering both developers and experimental biologists.

Future improvements include support for cloud autoscaling, a plugin store for shared components, and integration with workflow provenance standards (e.g., RO-Crate).

## 6. Conclusion

BRAVE is a modern, open-source platform that simplifies bioinformatics data analysis through interactive interfaces and reproducible workflows. Its combination of FastAPI, React, and Nextflow enables flexible, transparent, and efficient data processing, making it suitable for diverse bioinformatics applications.

## 7. Materials and Methods

BRAVE was implemented using:

* **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
* **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, Axios
* **Workflow Engine**: Nextflow DSL2, Docker/Singularity
* **Deployment**: Docker Compose / Kubernetes

Test datasets were obtained from GEO (GSE60450 for RNA-seq, GSE149938 for scRNA-seq). All software is open-source and hosted on GitHub.
